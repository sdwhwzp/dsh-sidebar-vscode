/**
 * DSH Selection Reference — editor side.
 *
 * Three commands, one envelope, one command channel:
 *
 * - "DSH: 发送选中代码到会话 / Send Selection to Session" (editor context
 *   menu, command palette, Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+C): packs the active selection(s) —
 *   file path, 1-based line range(s), language id, the exact text — into a
 *   selection payload.
 * - "DSH: 发送文件到会话 / Send File to Session" and "DSH: 发送文件夹到会话 /
 *   Send Folder to Session" (explorer context menu, shown per the kind of
 *   the right-clicked item): pack the selected file(s)/folder(s) — absolute
 *   path, workspace-relative path, and the kind (file|folder, via
 *   workspace.fs.stat) — into a resource payload
 *   `{ kind: 'resource', resources: [...] }`. No content is captured: the
 *   DSH side annotates the path and kind only. Command titles resolve from
 *   package.nls.json / package.nls.zh-cn.json per the display language.
 *
 * Both hand their JSON payload to `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText` inside an
 * envelope:
 *
 *   @@DSH_REF::<base64url(payload json)>::
 *   <human-readable fallback>
 *
 * Inside the DSH sidebar, the workbench window is same-origin with the DSH
 * page and dsh-sidebar-vscode patches navigator.clipboard.writeText, so the
 * write becomes a structured message: the payload is decoded and injected
 * into the conversation composer; on success nothing touches the real
 * clipboard (the readable part is written only when injection fails).
 * Standalone (no bridge), the envelope just lands on the
 * clipboard — paste it into the DSH composer and the paste-side fallback
 * recognizes the marker.
 *
 * The command channel (v0.1.1+): DSH's chat-side file opens (produced-file
 * chips, tool-row path links) are rerouted into this workbench. The plugin's
 * host half writes `<tmpdir>/dsh-sidebar-vscode/<slug(workspace)>/cmd.json`;
 * this extension polls that spool (500ms) and opens the addressed file with
 * `vscode.window.showTextDocument` — no workbench reload. A consumed command
 * is DELETED right after the open (v0.1.2: an untracked cmd.json is what
 * re-opened the last file on every workbench reboot — the sidebar tab's
 * iframe teardown/recreate restarts the extension host, and a fresh host
 * reading a stale cmd.json replays it), and commands older than
 * CHANNEL_CMD_TTL_MS are skipped and deleted on sight (a machine rebooted
 * across the write, or a spool restored from a snapshot, must never fire a
 * yesterday request). The consumed nonce watermark also persists in
 * `last.json` beside the spool, so a delete that failed (read-only mount)
 * still cannot replay across extension-host restarts. A `cap.json` marker
 * refreshed on every tick advertises liveness — AND build version — back:
 * it carries `{v:2,at}` (v0.1.2+), while the replaying v0.1.1 wrote a bare
 * timestamp; the client probes it through the plugin's fenced route and
 * only trusts the channel on v2+, falling back to a URL-payload reload
 * otherwise. The spool only works when DSH and the editor share the
 * filesystem (the default same-container topology).
 *
 * Embedded boots RECONCILE instead of trusting VS Code's editor-state
 * restore (v0.1.2+): the sidebar tab's iframe teardown skips VS Code's
 * unload lifecycle, so its periodic editor-state flush never lands for
 * edits made seconds before the close — and the next boot RESTORES a
 * stale editor set (a file the user closed reopens "by itself", flashes
 * open, …). The extension therefore keeps its own ledger (`editors.json`,
 * written synchronously on every tab change — immune to the teardown
 * race) and, at activation, reconciles the restored window against it:
 * restored tabs the ledger does not list are closed, ledger files the
 * restore lost are reopened, and the active editor is restored. The
 * sidebar's client hides the iframe (opacity 0) until the extension
 * reports completion through `boot.json` — echoing the boot nonce the
 * client parked in `bootreq.json` before the iframe ever loaded — so the
 * very first VISIBLE frame already shows the reconciled editor area:
 * nothing ever visibly opens just to be closed again. Dirty tabs are
 * never closed (data wins), and a boot with NO ledger (first ever boot
 * in a workspace, or a degraded URL-payload open) keeps VS Code's own
 * behavior untouched.
 *
 * The ledger is OWNED by the boot (v0.1.3+): serve-web keeps extension
 * hosts alive for a while after their renderer went away, and such a
 * lingering host would keep writing ITS (invisible) window's tab set into
 * the shared ledger — and re-opening ledger files into that window, whose
 * tab events then re-write the ledger again. Every ledger write and the
 * whole reconcile are therefore fenced on the boot nonce still being
 * current in `bootreq.json` (the client rotates it when a still-mounted
 * frame reloads, and as the tab unmounts), and a slow restore that lands
 * closed-file ghosts AFTER the reconcile is swept by the late-ghost
 * passes (close-only diffs spaced over the restore tail; the active
 * editor and dirty tabs are never theirs to close).
 *
 * No workspace-relative guessing here beyond asRelativePath: the payload
 * carries both the absolute path and the workspace-relative path; the DSH
 * side picks the display form and translates container paths back into the
 * DSH container's view using its own path-map settings.
