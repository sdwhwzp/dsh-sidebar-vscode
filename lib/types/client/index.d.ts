/**
 * Browser half of `dsh-sidebar-vscode`: a thin composition root over the
 * OFFICIAL right-Sidebar system. The plugin's client-side mechanisms live
 * in their own modules — the tab body (VscodeView.tsx and its
 * controllers), the reference pipeline (references.ts / composer.tsx /
 * referencePipeline.ts), the takeover family (takeovers.ts), the settings
 * card (settingsCard.tsx) — and this entry only wires them to the
 * services:
 *
 * - the `vscode` tab type, registered in the official two stages: the
 *   static definition into `ctx.sidebarRightTabs` (guide-page entry box
 *   included) and the body into the keyed `sidebar.right.pane.tab` seat
 *   under the definition's id — the embedded VS Code web workbench at the
 *   session's workspace;
 * - an `@`-trigger source named 'vscode-reference' whose codec serializes
 *   this plugin's occurrence chips back to their canonical mention at
 *   submit (the input machine routes serialization by source name);
 * - a reference lander shared by the clipboard bridge (tab component) and
 *   the paste fallback (composer dock): payload → chips on the addressed
 *   session's composer, plain-text mention as the degraded path;
 * - the takeover family (takeovers.ts): the official
 *   `ctx.sidebarRight.openResource` funnel, the collapsed column's expand
 *   button, and the settings page's「打开配置文件」button rerouted into
 *   the workbench tab, all behind the openAsDefault switch and the open
 *   blocklist;
 * - the configuration card (settingsCard.tsx) inside the official
 *   设置 → 插件 → 插件配置 tab, keyed by the `vscode-sidebar` namespace
 *   the Host half serves.
