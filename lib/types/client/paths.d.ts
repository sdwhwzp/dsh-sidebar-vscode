/**
 * Pure path/URL logic for the VSCode tab: translating the DSH session cwd
 * into the embedded VS Code server's view of the same directory, and building
 * the iframe URL. No DOM, no React — unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * Deployment assumption (this machine): the VS Code server (`code serve-web`)
 * runs INSIDE the dsh-runtime container itself, so the DSH session and the
 * embedded workbench see the very same filesystem under the very same paths:
 *
 *   DSH session (= VS Code server, one container)
 *   /data/workspace        (==)      /data/workspace
 *   /opt                   (==)      /opt
 *
 * The `pathMap` setting is therefore OPTIONAL and OFF by default: an unset
 * (or fully malformed) mapping yields NO rules, and every absolute path then
 * passes through unchanged — the workbench simply opens the raw session
 * directory. Configure rules only when the workbench runs elsewhere (split
 * container / different mounts): each rule rewrites one DSH-side source
 * prefix into the VS Code-side destination prefix (`src=dst`, `;`-joined,
 * longest source prefix wins). Even then, a path no rule matches still passes
 * through — the rules are PREFIX REWRITERS, never a whitelist: only empty or
 * non-absolute input is rejected ({@link mapPath} /
 * {@link reverseMapPath}). The `pathMap` key is settings-document-only
 * (no card row — see settingsCard.tsx); empty/unset is the
 * same-container default.
