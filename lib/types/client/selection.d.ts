/**
 * Pure logic for the clipboard envelope shared with the VS Code extension:
 * the wire codec and payload validation. No DOM, no React — unit-testable in
 * isolation.
 *
 * Wire format (the string the extension hands to
 * `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText`):
 *
 * ```
 * @@DSH_REF::<base64url(payload json)>::
 * <human-readable fallback snippet>
 * ```
 *
 * The payload is kind-discriminated: editor selections decode to a
 * {@link SelectionPayload} (no `kind` field — the historical shape), while
 * explorer file/folder selections decode to a {@link ResourceListPayload}
 * (`kind: 'resource'`, path + kind per item, never any content).
 *
 * The base64url alphabet contains no ':', so the closing '::' is an
 * unambiguous terminator. When the workbench runs inside this plugin's
 * iframe, the clipboard bridge intercepts the write before it reaches the
 * real clipboard, decodes the payload, and lands composer reference chips
 * (see references.ts); on a successful landing nothing touches the real
 * clipboard — the human-readable part is written only as a fallback when
 * the landing fails. Standalone (no bridge), the envelope lands on the
 * clipboard and the composer-side paste fallback recognizes the marker
 * instead.
