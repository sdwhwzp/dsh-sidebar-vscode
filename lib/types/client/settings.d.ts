/**
 * The `vscode-sidebar` settings read side: one typed window over the
 * official settings scope, plus the numeric capture-cap contract the
 * settings card and the reference pipeline share.
 *
 * The settings live in the Host-served user-settings document (namespace
 * `vscode-sidebar`; the Host half registers it — `src/settingsSection.ts`)
 * and reach the browser through `ctx.settingsScope.bind`. The card
 * (`settingsCard.tsx`) edits them there; the tab body and the takeover
 * gates read them per render / per call, so edits apply to the very next
 * interaction with no re-wiring.
 *
 * Fail-soft by construction: a scope that has not answered yet (or a
 * deployment serving no settings provider) reads as the composition base
 * — the same values the Host would resolve for an all-unset section — so
 * every consumer keeps working with the code defaults.
 *
 * Also owns the numeric capture-cap contract (`maxLines` / `maxBytes`):
 * the defaults and bounds live in `src/shared/settings.ts` (one source
 * shared with the Host schema), and the pure display/commit helpers here
 * serve the card and the read side alike.
 *
