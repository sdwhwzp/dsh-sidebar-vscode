/**
 * The turn-tail takeover (research option II): this plugin registers the
 * `conversation.chat.turnTail` slot at priority -2 — BEFORE
 * dsh-better-sidebar's own -1 entry — and claims the produced-files row
 * (the "changed files" chips at the end of a turn) with the same
 * `selectProducedFiles` derivation. The rendered row is a visual twin of
 * better-sidebar's, but the chips open the file in THIS plugin's VSCode tab
 * instead of the built-in editor tab.
 *
 * When the gate declines (the `openAsDefault` switch off, the VSCode tab
 * type disabled, the turn contains an explicit delivery, or it produced nothing) the select returns null and
 * the chain falls through untouched — better-sidebar's -1 entry, then the
 * default deliverables row — so switch-off keeps the stock behavior.
 *
 * Per-chip routing honors the open blocklist (openBlocklist.ts): a chip
 * whose path is blocked reroutes into better-sidebar's built-in Files tab
 * (its file viewers render the Office/image/PDF types the code editor
 * shows poorly). When that reroute declines — the Files tab type disabled
 * in the side card settings — the chip degrades to the render site's own
 * stock `openFile` (carried on the matched value), and finally to the
 * VSCode open (never a dead chip).
 *
 * The slot is a CHILD slot the host's ui-conversation declares in its
 * `conversation.chat.node` children table (kind: chain, scope: session).
 * Registering it directly races the declaration — the ui-slots core's
 * load-time validation throws "not declared (a parent entry's children
 * table must declare it)" when the parent entry is not on the ledger yet.
 * slots.inject waits for the declaration (mirrors better-sidebar's
 * registration of the same slot).
