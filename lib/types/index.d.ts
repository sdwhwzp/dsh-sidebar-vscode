/**
 * `dsh-sidebar-vscode`, node half: the vscode-selection context boundary
 * plus the extension command channel's two fenced routes.
 *
 * Everything UI-shaped (the better-sidebar VS Code tab, the composer
 * chips, the reference rail, the chat-open interception) lives in the
 * browser half. This half owns:
 *
 * - the model-facing seam: for every live agent it listens at
 *   `agent/pre-step`, expands canonical `dsh-vscode:` (editor selections)
 *   and `dsh-vscode-res:` (explorer file/folder) mentions in the claimed
 *   user messages into readable labels plus bounded `<text-selection>`
 *   context messages sourced `{ kind: 'vscode-mention', … }` — or, for
 *   resources, content-less `<file-selection>`/`<folder-selection>`
 *   markers sourced `{ kind: 'vscode-resource', … }` (see `src/mention.ts`);
 *
 * - `/sidebar-vscode/api/open.capability` + `/open.request`: the spool the
 *   embedded workbench's extension polls (see `src/openChannel.ts`), fenced
 *   by the same browser-trust rules as every other plugin route; the
 *   `boot.begin` / `boot.status` pair rides the same fence to gate the
 *   iframe reveal on the extension's post-reconcile boot receipt;
 *
 * - `/sidebar-vscode/api/settings.document`: locates the settings provider's
 *   local document (prepareDocument) for the browser-half takeover of the
 *   settings page's「打开配置文件」button — the stock /api method opens it
 *   with the Host OS opener (dead on headless containers) and never reveals
 *   the path; this route hands the path to this plugin's own fenced channel
 *   so the file can open inside the embedded VS Code instead.
 *
 * - the same-origin VS Code reverse proxy (see `src/vscodeProxy.ts`),
 *   mounted at `/sidebar/vscode`: an HTTP prefix route plus the discovered
 *   WebSocket upgrade path, so gateway-less deployments (Windows, LAN)
 *   still get a same-origin workbench iframe. `/sidebar-vscode/api/
 *   proxy.config` lets the browser half push the `serverUrl` setting (a
 *   full serve-web URL, base path + token) as the proxy's upstream, with a
 *   bounded reachability probe in the answer; `proxy.status` reports the
 *   live mounting state for the iframe-base choice.
