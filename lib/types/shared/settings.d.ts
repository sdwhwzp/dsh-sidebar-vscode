/**
 * The `vscode-sidebar` settings model, shared by both plugin halves.
 *
 * The settings live in the OFFICIAL user-settings document under one
 * namespace (`vscode-sidebar`), not in any sidebar plugin's private blob:
 * the Host half registers the section (`src/settingsSection.ts`) so the
 * settings serve it, and the「设置 → 插件 → 插件配置」tab pairs that
 * namespace with this plugin's browser-registered card
 * (`settings.plugin.item`, keyed by the same string).
 *
 * This module is the ONE source of truth both halves compile against —
 * the Host half's schema defaults and the browser half's
 * settings-not-ready-yet fallbacks must never disagree:
 *
 * - `openAsDefault` gates the three file-open takeovers (chat-originated
 *   opens through `ctx.sidebarRight.openResource`, the collapsed column's
 *   expand button, and the settings page's「打开配置文件」button). The
 *   better-sidebar-era meaning — swapping a fresh session's seeded Files
 *   tab — is gone with that system (the official sidebar seeds the guide
 *   page and keeps layout in memory only); the switch keeps its takeover
 *   roles.
 * - `openBlocklist` carries the unset-versus-empty rule through the
 *   settings document's own layering: the composition base IS the
 *   default list, an explicit `[]` is the stored decision "block
 *   nothing".
 *
