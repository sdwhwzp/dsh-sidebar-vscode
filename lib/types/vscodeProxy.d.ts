/**
 * The same-origin VS Code reverse proxy: mounts a `code serve-web`
 * instance under the DSH web port itself (`/sidebar/vscode`), so the
 * embedded workbench iframe is same-origin with the DSH shell without any
 * external gateway — keeping the clipboard signal bridge intact on
 * gateway-less deployments (Windows, LAN).
 *
 * Both legs (the HTTP mount and the WebSocket upgrade route) sit behind
 * the same browser-trust fence as every other plugin route
 * (`isTrustedApiRequest`, see trust-fence.ts): the DSH page, its iframe,
 * and direct bookmark navigations pass; cross-site pages are refused —
 * WebSocket handshakes are not CORS-checked by browsers, and serve-web's
 * `handleUpgrade` ignores the connection token, so an unfenced upgrade
 * leg would be a cross-site-hijack tunnel into the workbench.
 *
 * Upstream selection, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. **The `serverUrl` setting carrying a full URL** (pushed by the
 *    browser half through the fenced `/sidebar-vscode/api/proxy.config`
 *    route — `configure()`): exactly what `code serve-web` printed,
 *    origin + base path + query (the `?tkn=` token) included. The query
 *    is appended to every proxied HTTP request (serve-web checks the
 *    token on requests only — its `handleUpgrade` ignores it).
 * 2. `DSH_SIDEBAR_VSCODE_UPSTREAM` (`off`-like sentinels disable; a full
 *    URL, default `http://127.0.0.1:8000` — a bare local serve-web).
 *
 * Path mapping: the workbench bakes `serverBasePath` (from serve-web's own
 * `--server-base-path`) into every absolute URL it renders, and connects
 * its WebSocket at `<serverBasePath>/<quality>-<commit>`. The probe reads
 * that baked base from the index HTML and RECONCILES the routing to it —
 * the URL names the entry point, the HTML names the routing (a `/vscode`
 * server answers `/` with the same `/vscode`-rooted page). For the
 * resulting base path `P` the proxy registers:
 *
 * - the mount `/sidebar/vscode` rewriting `/sidebar/vscode<rest>` →
 *   `P<rest>` (the page URL, bookmarks, the iframe target);
 * - an identity mirror at `P` itself when `P` is neither `/` (the SPA
 *   owns the root) nor the mount;
 * - a discovered shim at `/<quality>-<commit>` when `P` is `/` (the
 *   root-absolute resource URLs);
 * - one exact upgrade route at `P/<quality>-<commit>` — the only path
 *   the browser socket factory ever connects to.
 *
 * The browser's `Host` header is kept verbatim, so serve-web bakes
 * `remoteAuthority` pointing at the DSH port and every workbench URL
 * (resources, callbacks, WebSocket) flows back through this proxy. The
 * index probe follows up to three redirects and adopts the final origin,
 * so an upstream behind a redirecting reverse proxy (e.g. an enforced
 * http→https hop) still discovers — and forwards — correctly.
 *
 * The `<quality>-<commit>` prefix is re-discovered (throttled) whenever
 * the workbench HTML itself is served — awaited on the first page load,
 * so a serve-web update swaps the routes before subresources fire.
 * Registration is probe-gated for the env source (a silent default claims
 * nothing) but immediate for the settings source (the user asked for this
 * upstream — an unreachable one answers honest 502s). `status()` reports
 * both shapes: `mounted` (routes claimed) and `serving` (probe succeeded
 * and every planned route is live — the only state the iframe may target
 * the mount in). A route owned by another plugin disables the feature
 * with a warning.
