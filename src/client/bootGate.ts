/**
 * The boot gate of the VSCode tab — the mechanism that keeps a freshly
 * loading workbench iframe invisible (opacity 0) until its editor area is
 * reconciled, so nothing ever visibly opens just to be closed again.
 *
 * Two layers live here:
 *
 * - {@link watchBootQuiet}, the DOM-quiet fallback reveal for workbench
 *   loads whose boot nonce could not be parked with the node half (an
 *   older host half whose `boot.begin` / `boot.status` routes are not
 *   loaded yet — the exact handshake is in `openChannelApi.ts` and takes
 *   over once the host restarts);
 * - {@link BootGateController}, the full nonce-handshake state machine
 *   the VscodeView drives (`begin` on every frame load key, `frameLoaded`
 *   on the iframe's load event, `fence` on unmount): it parks the boot
 *   nonce BEFORE the frame mounts, awaits the extension's post-reconcile
 *   receipt echoing it, rotates the nonce when a still-mounted frame
 *   RELOADS in place, and reveals when the receipt matches, the workbench
 *   DOM renders quiet AND matches the parked boot ledger, or a bounded
 *   timeout expires — whichever comes first. All timing and transport
 *   are injected, so the whole machine is unit-testable without a DOM.
 *
 * While the iframe sits hidden, VS Code's own editor restore and the
 * extension's boot reconcile both mutate the editor tab strip; when that
 * strip has held still for a quiet window (or the receipt landed) the
 * first VISIBLE frame already shows the reconciled editor area.
 *
 * Every layer is deliberately conservative and fail-soft: a cross-origin
 * frame (no readable document) reveals immediately (stock behavior, the
 * direct-iframe fallback), a shell that never renders falls to the bounded
 * timeout, and every signal is re-sampled live so a late mutation always
 * re-arms the quiet window.
 *
 * @module dsh-sidebar-vscode/client/bootGate
