/**
 * The focus fence of the embedded workbench: the controller that bounces
 * focus entries into the VS Code iframe back to the surface that held
 * focus last, unless the user actually aimed at the workbench.
 *
 * Why a fence at all: the VS Code workbench PROGRAMMATICALLY focuses its
 * own content shortly after it boots — the Getting Started page calls
 * focus() on itself when it renders, and a restored workspace focuses the
 * editor it restored — typically 0.5–4s after the iframe loads, with zero
 * user interaction. Whenever that boot happens at a moment the user did
 * not aim at the workbench (a new session's default tab behind a
 * collapsed panel; switching back to a session whose workspace remounts
 * the panel; a page reload), the grab rips the caret out of wherever it
 * belongs — usually the freshly-autofocused composer.
 *
 * The DECISION logic is pure and lives in focusGuard.ts (`fenceShouldBounce`,
 * `FocusRestoreBudget` — unit-tested there). This controller owns the
 * plumbing around it: the parent-document listeners for the component's
 * whole life, the per-load gesture trackers inside the frame document,
 * and the visibility/boot arming windows. Two armed situations:
 *
 * 1. HIDDEN (`visible === false`, explicit only): every entry is a steal
 *    — a hidden frame cannot receive user clicks.
 * 2. BOOT: for a window after EVERY load of the frame (each load is a
 *    workbench boot, and every boot self-focuses). Entries bounce UNLESS
 *    the user gestured inside the frame (same-origin pointerdown/keydown
 *    trackers, re-attached on every load — a cross-origin frame cannot
 *    report gestures, so the boot fence stands down rather than bounce
 *    real clicks) or a parent Tab keypress handed focus over. The ONE
 *    sanctioned boot is the deferred first load of a component that
 *    mounted hidden: the user revealed the tab to release it, so its
 *    focus grab is welcome (see {@link FocusFenceController.onFrameLoad}).
 *
 * Detection rides FOCUSOUT, not focusin: a focus crossing INTO the iframe
 * fires focusout in the parent document but never focusin — the focusin
 * lands inside the frame's own document.
