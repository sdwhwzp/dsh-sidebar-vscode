/**
 * The open-blocklist contract: file types the chat-open takeover must NOT
 * claim. When the `openAsDefault` switch is on, every chat-originated file
 * open (tool-row path links, prose file mentions, produced-files chips)
 * is rerouted into the VSCode tab — but some files (Office documents,
 * images, PDFs) belong to the sidebar's viewer surface, not a code
 * editor. This module owns the whole pure contract both sides share:
 *
 * - the stored shape (the `vscode-sidebar` settings section's
 * `openBlocklist` field — a string array of file extensions) and its
 * base default (the seven common binary types below; the official
 * settings layering makes unset resolve to that base, so an explicit
 * `[]` remains the stored decision "block nothing");
 * - normalization (case-insensitive, dot-tolerant, charset-checked) and
 *   matching (a path is blocked when its lowercased BASE NAME ends with
 *   `'.' + extension` — one rule that covers single-part (`pdf`),
 *   treats `a.notpdf` as NOT matching `pdf`, needs no special case for
 *   extension-less files, and supports multi-part extensions such as
 *   `tar.gz` when the entry itself carries the dot).
 *
 * The read side is per-call (readOpenBlocklist): the takeover gate calls
 * it on every open, so settings edits apply to the very next click with
 * no re-wiring.
 *
 * Scope: ONLY the chat-open seam (openIntercept.ts's wrapper). The
 * settings-page「打开配置文件」takeover (settingsTakeover.ts)
 * deliberately ignores this list — it opens a text document through its
 * own resolve route, and honoring the list there would let a blacklisted
 * `yaml` break the button.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design so the contract is unit-testable in isolation.
 *
