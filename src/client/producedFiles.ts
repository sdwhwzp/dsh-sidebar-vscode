/**
 * Pure derivation of one turn's produced files from finalized conversation
 * nodes — a structural REPLICA of dsh-better-sidebar's produced-files.ts
 * (itself a replica of ui-deliverables' `producedForClosing`: the mutation
 * tools' follow-along `locations`, by render intent — a diff card or a
 * generic edit card; reads/deletes/failures produce nothing). Replicated
 * here (not imported from the peer) so this plugin's turn-tail takeover
 * stays self-contained in the client bundle and unit-testable without the
 * peer installed; keep in sync when the upstream drifts.
 *
 * The slot `select` itself (selectProducedFiles, below) reads the ENGINE's
 * Turn data first — `owner.turn.data.get('deliverables')`, exactly what
 * ui-deliverables' own registration reads — and keeps this node walk only
 * as a fallback: the real render site (ui-conversation's TurnTailNodeView)
 * hands entries a `{ turn, seq, openFile }` owner with NO `nodes` field, so
 * a nodes-only select can never match.
 *
 * Used by the turn-tail interception (turnTail.tsx) to claim the
 * produced-files row — the "changed files" chips at the end of a turn —
 * and reroute their clicks into the VSCode tab.
