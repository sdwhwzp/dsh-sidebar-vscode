/**
 * The reference pipeline's shared handle table: the lander the plugin
 * body installs (consumed by the tab's clipboard bridge) and the
 * paste-fallback options the tab keeps fresh — one typed home for what
 * used to be scattered module-level mutable singletons.
 *
 * The split is deliberate: the plugin BODY owns the service context
 * (sessions/conversation) and installs the lander; the TAB owns the live
 * per-session values (pathMap/cwd/caps) and refreshes the options; the
 * DOCK reads both at paste time. A single module (the plugin is a
 * singleton per page) is the simplest wiring that keeps all three
 * decoupled — no prop drilling through the host's slot faces, and
 * no React context the bridge (a plain DOM callback) could not reach.
