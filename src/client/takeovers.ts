/**
 * The takeover family's installation for the OFFICIAL right Sidebar: the
 * seams that reroute a host-side file open into the embedded VS Code
 * workbench, wired through ONE gate and live settings reads.
 *
 * - **The chat-open seam** (`openIntercept.ts`): `ctx.sidebarRight
 *   .openResource` — the official navigation controller's public resource
 *   funnel and the one route every chat-originated open of the current
 *   runtime takes (ui-chat's `openFile`: tool-row path links and prose
 *   mentions; the deliverables row's produced-files chips). The wrapper
 *   claims the open for the workbench (`openTab('vscode', { params })`)
 *   or falls through untouched — switch off, blocklisted path, or an
 *   unresolvable session scope — to the stock registry routing, where
 *   the official text preview (or a future viewer plugin) claims it.
 * - **The settings open-document seam** (`settingsTakeover.ts`): the
 *   settings page's「打开配置文件」click resolves the document through
 *   this plugin's own fenced node-half route and opens it in the
 *   workbench tab, closing the settings dialog behind it. Two era-specific
 *   seams (`remote.settings.openSettingsDocument` vs the legacy
 *   `connection.api.settings.openDocument`); exactly one ever intercepts.
 * - **The expand-button seam** (`expandTakeover.ts`): the collapsed
 *   column's header control (the one node carrying
 *   `data-sidebar-right-expand`) captured at the document's capture phase
 *   and re-issued as `openTab('vscode')`, so a switch-on deployment's
 *   expand click lands directly on the workbench tab instead of the seeded
 *   guide — the stock `setExpanded` the button would have run is subsumed
 *   by the open's own expansion, and a declined or failed claim leaves the
 *   stock expand untouched.
 *
 * Cross-cutting wiring that lives HERE so no seam carries its own copy:
 *
 * - the gate: `takeoverEnabled` = the `openAsDefault` switch resolved from
 *   the live settings scope (evaluated per call, so flipping the switch
 *   applies to the very next click);
 * - the open blocklist (`openBlocklist.ts`), read per call from the same
 *   scope: a file type the code editor renders poorly (Office/image/PDF …)
 *   declines the VSCode reroute and falls through to the official
 *   sidebar's own viewer surface;
 * - session addressing: the session-scope address translation resolves
 *   the workspace root from the sessions registry's live snapshot.
