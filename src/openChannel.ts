/**
 * Host half of the extension command channel: the /tmp spool the embedded
 * workbench's `dsh.selection-reference` extension (≥ 0.1.1) polls.
 *
 * Layout: `<tmpdir>/dsh-sidebar-vscode/<slug(workspace folder)>/{cap,cmd,editors,bootreq,boot}.json`
 * — one directory per workspace folder, addressed by a filesystem-safe slug
 * BOTH sides derive from the folder path they independently know (the client
 * sends the mapped folder; the extension derives it from its own
 * `workspaceFolders[0]`). `/tmp` is shared by the default same-container
 * topology (serve-web runs beside dsh-runtime — see the plugin README's
 * deployment section); a split deployment simply fails the capability probe
 * and the client falls back to the URL-payload channel.
 *
 * - `cap.json` — the extension's liveness marker (`{v,at}`, written by
 *   builds ≥ 0.1.2 and refreshed on its poll tick whenever older than a
 *   minute); the route only reports it fresh AND versioned within
 *   {@link CAPABILITY_MAX_AGE_MS}, so a dead extension stops being
 *   "capable" within that window after its last write — and a deployment
 *   still carrying the pre-0.1.2 build (whose bare-timestamp marker fails
 *   the version parse) is never handed commands at all: that build
 *   replayed the last command on every extension-host restart.
 * - `cmd.json` — the last open command (atomic tmp+rename write). The
 *   consuming extension (≥ 0.1.2) deletes it once acted on, drops entries
 *   older than its command TTL, and keeps a monotonic nonce watermark in
 *   `last.json` — three independent guards against the same replay: a
 *   sidebar tab close/reopen tears down and reboots the workbench, and a
 *   fresh extension host reading a leftover cmd.json re-opened the file
 *   the user had just closed.
 *
 * The slug spec is pinned by `tests/openChannel.spec.ts`; the extension's
 * plain-JS mirror (extension/extension.js `slugOf`) must stay in lockstep.
 *
